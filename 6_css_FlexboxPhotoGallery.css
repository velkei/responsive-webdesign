/*
Flexbox has a main and cross axis. 
The main axis is defined by the flex-direction property, 
which has four possible values:

row (default): horizontal axis with flex items from left to right
row-reverse: horizontal axis with flex items from right to left
column: vertical axis with flex items from top to bottom
column-reverse: vertical axis with flex items from bottom to top

Note: The axes and directions will be different depending on the text direction. 
The values shown are for a left-to-right text direction.



The flex-wrap property determines how your flex items behave
when the flex container is too small.
Setting it to wrap will allow the items 
to wrap to the next row or column. nowrap (default)
will prevent your items from wrapping and shrink them if needed.

The justify-content property determines how the items inside
a flex container are positioned along the main axis, 
affecting their position and the space around them.

The align-items property positions the flex content along 
the cross axis. In this case, with your flex-direction set to row, 
your cross axis would be vertical.

Notice how some of your images have become distorted. 
This is because the images have different aspect ratios. 
Rather than setting each aspect ratio individually, 
you can use the object-fit property to determine how images should behave.

Give your .gallery img selector the object-fit property 
and set it to cover. This will tell the image to fill 
the img container while maintaining aspect ratio, 
resulting in cropping to fit.

Your images need some space between them.

The gap CSS shorthand property sets the gaps, 
also knowns as gutters, between rows and columns. 
The gap property and its row-gap and 
column-gap sub-properties provide this functionality 
for flex, grid, and multi-column layout. 
You apply the property to the container element.

Give your .gallery flex container a gap property with 16px as the value.

The ::after pseudo-element creates an element that is 
the last child of the selected element. We can use it 
to add an empty element after the last image. 
If we give it the same width as the images it will push 
the last image to the left when the gallery is in a two-column layout. 
Right now, it is in the center because we set justify-content: 
center on the flex container.

Example:

.container::after {
  content: "";
  width: 860px;
}
Create a new selector using an ::after pseudo-element 
on the .gallery element. Add a content property 
set to an empty string "" and 350px set for the width property.
